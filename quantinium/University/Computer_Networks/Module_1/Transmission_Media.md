title: Transmission Media
---

Transmission media in computer networks refers to the physical pathways or channels through which data is transmitted from one device to another. These media can be broadly categorized into two types: guided (wired) and unguided (wireless) media.

## **Guided transmission media**
**Twisted Pair Cable** is a type of **guided (wired) transmission medium** widely used in computer networks and telecommunications. It consists of **pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together** to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk from external sources or adjacent wires. The twisting helps improve signal quality and allows for reliable data transmission over short to medium distances.

#### **Types of Twisted Pair Cable:**
1. **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):**
   - **Description:** The most common type of twisted pair cable, with no additional shielding around the wires.
   - **Applications:** Used in Ethernet networks (e.g., LANs), telephone systems, and other communication systems.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Inexpensive and easy to install.
     - Flexible and lightweight.
     - Suitable for short-distance communication.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - More susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk.
     - Limited bandwidth compared to other media like fiber optics.

2. **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):**
   - **Description:** Similar to UTP, but with an additional metallic shielding (foil or braided mesh) around the twisted pairs to reduce interference.
   - **Applications:** Used in environments with high EMI, such as industrial settings or areas with heavy electrical equipment.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Better protection against EMI and crosstalk.
     - Higher data transmission rates over longer distances compared to UTP.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - More expensive and bulkier than UTP.
     - Harder to install due to the shielding.
