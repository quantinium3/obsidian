Process-to-process delivery is a fundamental concept in computer networking where data is transmitted between applications (processes) running on different hosts. This is achieved using **transport layer protocols** such as **UDP (User Datagram Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**. Each protocol has distinct characteristics, making them suitable for different types of communication.

## **1. Process-to-Process Delivery**
Before diving into UDP, TCP, and SCTP, it's essential to understand how data moves between processes.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Host-to-Host vs. Process-to-Process:**
  - **Host-to-Host (Network Layer - IP):** Ensures data reaches the correct machine.
  - **Process-to-Process (Transport Layer - UDP/TCP/SCTP):** Ensures data reaches the correct application on that machine.
  
- **Port Numbers:**
  - Used to identify processes (applications).
  - **Well-known ports (0–1023):** HTTP (80), FTP (21), SSH (22).
  - **Registered ports (1024–49151):** Assigned by IANA for specific services.
  - **Dynamic/Private ports (49152–65535):** Used temporarily by clients.

- **Multiplexing & Demultiplexing:**
  - **Multiplexing:** Combining multiple application data streams into one transport layer segment.
  - **Demultiplexing:** Separating received data and delivering it to the correct application.

## **2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
### **Overview:**
- **Connectionless:** No handshaking before sending data.
- **Unreliable:** No guarantees for delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.
- **Lightweight:** Low overhead (small header, no flow/error control).

### **UDP Header (8 Bytes)**
| Field            | Size (Bytes) | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Source Port      | 2            | Sender’s port (optional, can be 0) |
| Destination Port | 2            | Receiver’s port                    |
| Length           | 2            | Total length (header + data)       |
| Checksum         | 2            | Error detection (optional)         |

### **Characteristics of UDP:**
1. **No Connection Establishment:** Data is sent immediately.
2. **No Acknowledgments (ACKs):** No retransmission of lost packets.
3. **No Flow Control:** Sender can overwhelm the receiver.
4. **No Congestion Control:** Can contribute to network congestion.
5. **Supports Multicast & Broadcast:** Useful for streaming, DNS, DHCP.

### **Use Cases:**
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Fast lookups.
- **VoIP (Voice over IP):** Real-time communication.
- **Online Gaming:** Low latency preferred over reliability.
- **IoT & Sensor Data:** Small, frequent transmissions.

## **3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
### **Overview:**
- **Connection-Oriented:** Requires a **three-way handshake** before data transfer.
- **Reliable:** Guarantees delivery, ordering, and error detection.
- **Flow & Congestion Control:** Prevents overwhelming the receiver or network.

### **TCP Header (20–60 Bytes)**
| Field                 | Size (Bytes) | Description                             |
| --------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Source Port           | 2            | Sender’s port                           |
| Destination Port      | 2            | Receiver’s port                         |
| Sequence Number       | 4            | Byte position in the stream             |
| Acknowledgment Number | 4            | Next expected byte                      |
| Header Length         | 1.5          | Size of the header (in 32-bit words)    |
| Control Flags         | 1.5          | SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, etc.                |
| Window Size           | 2            | Receiver’s buffer size (flow control)   |
| Checksum              | 2            | Error detection                         |
| Urgent Pointer        | 2            | Points to urgent data (if URG flag set) |
| Options               | 0–40         | Additional features (MSS, SACK, etc.)   |

### **Key Features of TCP:**
1. **Three-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment):**
   - **SYN** → **SYN-ACK** → **ACK**
   - Ensures both sides are ready.

2. **Reliable Data Transfer:**
   - **Sequence Numbers:** Track byte order.
   - **ACKs:** Confirm received data.
   - **Retransmission:** Lost packets are resent.

3. **Flow Control (Sliding Window):**
   - Adjusts sending rate based on receiver’s buffer.

4. **Congestion Control (AIMD, Slow Start):**
   - Prevents network overload.

5. **Connection Termination (Four-Way Handshake):**
   - **FIN** → **ACK** → **FIN** → **ACK**

### **Use Cases:**
- **HTTP/HTTPS (Web Browsing):** Reliable page loading.
- **FTP (File Transfer):** Ensures complete file delivery.
- **Email (SMTP):** Guarantees message integrity.
- **SSH (Secure Shell):** Secure remote access.

## **4. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**
### **Overview:**
- **Combines features of TCP & UDP:** Reliable like TCP, but message-oriented like UDP.
- **Multi-homing & Multi-streaming:** Supports multiple IP paths and parallel streams.
- **Resistant to DoS attacks:** Better security than TCP.

### **SCTP Header (12+ Bytes)**
| Field            | Size (Bytes) | Description                      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Source Port      | 2            | Sender’s port                    |
| Destination Port | 2            | Receiver’s port                  |
| Verification Tag | 4            | Protects against blind attacks   |
| Checksum         | 4            | Error detection                  |
| Chunks           | Variable     | Data, control, or error messages |

### **Key Features of SCTP:**
1. **Message-Oriented (Like UDP):** Preserves message boundaries.
2. **Reliable (Like TCP):** ACKs, retransmissions, and sequencing.
3. **Multi-Streaming:** Multiple independent data streams in one connection.
4. **Multi-Homing:** Can use multiple network paths for redundancy.
5. **No Head-of-Line Blocking:** Lost packet in one stream doesn’t block others.

### **Use Cases:**
- **VoIP & Video Conferencing:** Handles multiple streams efficiently.
- **Telecom Signaling (SIGTRAN):** SS7 over IP.
- **WebRTC:** Real-time communication.
- **High-Availability Systems:** Multi-homing for failover.
