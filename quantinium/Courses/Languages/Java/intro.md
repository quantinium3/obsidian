- Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems. It is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
- It was intended to let programmers write once and run anywhere meaning that compiled java can run on all platforms without the need to recompile.
- Java application are typically compiled to bytecode that run on a JVM regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
- Syntax of java is similar to that of c or c++ but has fewer low level facilities.
- It is a garbage collected language meaning manual memory allocations are unneeded and garbage collector is responsible for reclaiming space from objects that are not longer in use.
- Java bytecode is independant of hardware architecture, relying on the JVM to handle platform-specific details.
- It has a rich standard library.
