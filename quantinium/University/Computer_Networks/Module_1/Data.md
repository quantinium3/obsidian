### **Representation of Data**  
Data representation refers to the way data is stored, processed, and transmitted within a system. It defines how various types of data (numbers, characters, images, etc.) are encoded for efficient computation and communication. Some common forms of data representation include:  

1. **Binary Representation**:  
   - All data in computers is ultimately stored in binary (0s and 1s).  
   - Example: The number **5** in binary is **101**.  

2. **Number Systems**:  
   - **Decimal (Base 10)**: Used by humans (0-9).  
   - **Binary (Base 2)**: Used by computers (0,1).  
   - **Octal (Base 8)**: Sometimes used in computing (0-7).  
   - **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Common in programming (0-9, A-F).  

3. **Character Representation**:  
   - **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**: Uses 7 or 8 bits to represent characters.  
   - **Unicode**: Supports a wide range of characters using 16-bit or more.  

4. **Data Structures**:  
   - **Primitive Data Types**: Integer, Float, Boolean, Character.  
   - **Complex Data Types**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs.  

5. **Images and Multimedia**:  
   - **Images**: Represented using pixel values (e.g., RGB format).  
   - **Audio and Video**: Stored as digital signals, often compressed (MP3, MP4).

### **Five Components of Data Communication**

1. **Sender** – The device that initiates the communication (e.g., a computer, phone).
2. **Message** – The actual data being transmitted (text, audio, video, etc.).
3. **Medium** – The transmission path that carries the message (wire, fiber optics, radio waves).
4. **Receiver** – The device that receives and interprets the message.
5. **Protocol** – A set of rules that governs data communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).

### **Data Flow (Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex)**
#### **a. Simplex Communication**
- Data flows **in only one direction** (unidirectional).
- The sender transmits, and the receiver only receives.
- Example: **TV broadcasting**, where a station sends signals, and viewers only receive.

#### **b. Half-Duplex Communication**
- Data flows **in both directions but only one at a time**.
- Devices take turns transmitting and receiving.
- Example: **Walkie-talkies**, where one person speaks while the other listens, then switches.

#### **c. Full-Duplex Communication**
- Data flows **simultaneously in both directions**.
- Both sender and receiver can transmit and receive at the same time.
- Example: **Phone calls**, where both parties can talk and listen simultaneously.
